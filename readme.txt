This is more of a personal discord bot I'm creating, it is more splatoon related as it has many features relating to the game. I plan to eventually connect it to the Nintendo switch onlineapp and be able to extract data and make requests there. I have a few friends contributing to the project at the moment. 

In order to run the bot, you'll need the API token for the discord bot and to download the package dependencies found in dependencies.txt.

Once you are ready python main.py will turn the bot on.
